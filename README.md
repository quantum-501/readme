hi, i'm Junheng, nice to e-meet you visiting my github. And i was a UX designer but now decide to be a front-end engineer or software engineering.
you may be curious about why i consider as a developer in rest of career? The simplest reason is i am passionate about developing one software. To be detailed, when i occasionally selected up one optonal module namaed Digital Sandbox and studyed it at autumn semester last year untill spring autume this year, i found it funny and shocked to build in any software application i wanted, this inspired me to have the motivation that studyed one program language to develop a web app anyway, except from the reason, the teacher of this module also share his working experience as a developer, which also attracted my attention to developer. Last reason i will mentioned, as we known, designers play a role in a product deveopment team less than developers' effort. 

Given that having one proposal for career development, it is important to make effort to acquire what i should be done, at the begining of this learning process, i started learning the basics of web development by w3schools and took exercises at freecodecamp where i got certification beacause of completing a large number of puzzles. After that, i considered it crucial to gain a better understanding of data sturcture and algorithm, and read relevant books, tried to address numerous question from Leetcode. It is pretty challenging for me! you know, i have not any exxperience or background about compute science. Even though i faced huge obstacles to understand every basic concepts or method of data sturcture and algorithm, i never give up it and take over it, sometimes one quzzle was able to take one more day to cope with one solution.

In order to give myself confidence i documentaried own self-reflection every day so that make sense what achievement i have got today and what flaws i should address tommorrow and so on.

Learning process is quite boring, however i have no choice!
